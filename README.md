# ETL of Invoices with Python and AI

This project involves the **extraction of information** from digital invoices in PDF format using **free artificial intelligence models**, which is then **loaded into an SQL database**â€”in this case, **SQLite**. The extracted data is then analyzed using **Power BI**.

The sample invoices shown here were generated using AI.
